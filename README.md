 Portfolio project: Clone of Sylani Welfare Trust homepage using HTML &amp; CSS. Future plan includes integrating JavaScript for enhanced interactivity. Showcases frontend skills and commitment to continuous improvement.

# Description
In this portfolio project, I have meticulously cloned the home page of Sylani Welfare Trust using only HTML and CSS. Sylani Welfare Trust is a prominent organization known for its dedication to humanitarian causes, and I aimed to replicate its website's design and layout faithfully.

The project showcases my proficiency in HTML and CSS, as I carefully crafted each element to mirror the original design. From the header to the footer, every section has been meticulously recreated, paying attention to details such as fonts, colors, and layout.

While the current version of the project utilizes only HTML and CSS, I have plans to enhance its interactivity by integrating JavaScript in the future. By incorporating JavaScript, I aim to add dynamic elements and interactive features to the website, elevating the user experience and functionality.

This portfolio project demonstrates not only my ability to recreate complex designs using frontend technologies but also my commitment to continuous improvement and learning. As I expand my skill set to include JavaScript, I look forward to further enhancing this project and creating even more engaging and dynamic web experiences.
